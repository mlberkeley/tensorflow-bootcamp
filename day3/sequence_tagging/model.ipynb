    "# Sequence Tagging (Named Entity Recognition) with Tensorflow:\n",
    "Implement a sequence tagging model using tensorflow. Apparently this demo has state-of-the-art performance (F1 score close to 91) given a large enough corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence, give a tag to each word. A classical application is Named Entity Recognition (NER). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia:\n",
    "Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "John  lives in New   York  and works for the European Union\n",
    "B-PER O     O  B-LOC I-LOC O   O     O   O   B-ORG    I-ORG\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CoNLL2003 task, the entities are LOC, PER, ORG and MISC for locations, persons, orgnizations and miscellaneous. The no-entity tag is O. Because some entities (like New York) have multiple words, we use a tagging scheme to distinguish between the beginning (tag B-...), or the inside of an entity (tag I-...). Other tagging schemes exist (IOBES, etc). Tagging schemes are arbitrarily determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very High Level Overview of Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Representation: Word vector w \\in R^{n}. In this case, we're using GloVe, but other word embeddings include Word2Vec, Senna, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual Word Representation: Use an LSTM to represent for each word in its context (via hidden layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoding: Once we have a vector representing each word, we can use it to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lower Level Overview of Model\n",
    "Similar to [Lample et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360) and [Ma and Hovy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01354.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "- concatenate final states of a bi-lstm on character embeddings to get a character-based representation of each word\n",
    "- concatenate this representation to a standard word vector representation (GloVe here)\n",
    "- run a bi-lstm on each sentence to extract contextual representation of each word\n",
    "- decode with a linear chain CRF\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "Follow Step 1., ..., Step n. to complete the model.\n",
